# F1 Driver Data Analysis using PowerBi
This project is based on the dataset of F1 drivers where we are trying to convert raw data into meaningful information by using intuitive visualizations and tables. Here we are first using Python for basic data preprocessing and to clear out basic decripencies in data. And after that we will be using Power BI to make beautiful and meaningful insights and try to answer some questions from the data. This project is made for portfolio purpose only, showcase python and Power BI skills.
